# Experimental insight into the entrainment and transport of subglacial debris

**Dougal Hansen**

**Abstract**: The transport and evacuation of subglacial sediment (i.e till) during basal slip is an important mediator for the flow dynamics and erosive capacity for many fast-moving ice streams. Subglacial sediment flux for these systems is facilitated primarily by 1) the deformation of sediment in response to overriding ice and 2) the entrainment of debris in basal ice. However, their relative contribution to the sediment budget and their controlling processes are poorly constrained for most glacial environments. We address this deficiency with a novel ring shear device capable of simulating glacier sliding in the lab under realistic conditions. Here we present results from two sets of experiments designed to elucidate key controls on subglacial sediment flux by sliding rings of temperate ice over a sandy, subglacial till. The first set of experiments systematically tested the influence of sliding velocity (25-300 m/yr) and effective stress (4-196 kPa) on the vertical distribution of strain in the till column -- key variables in prominent glaciological models with little constraint. The second set of experiments provides preliminary insight into the processes driving sediment entrainment and its influence on basal friction. Motion in the till bed was recorded by photographing the sediment through clear acrylic walls at regular intervals and using particle image velocimetry to estimate the displacement that occurred between image captures. For the deformation experiments (set 1), we find steady-state deformation was accommodated in a thin shear band (O(10-2 m)) near the ice sole. Sediment flux scaled linearly with the velocity of basal ice and shows a double-value relationship with effective stress (i.e. increasing to a maximum at N~40 before dropping off at higher stresses). Preliminary results for the sediment entrainment experiments suggest that granular physics dominate the frictional response even in the presence of a frozen fringe of sediment in basal ice.
