# Fracturing and pore fluid distribution in the Marlborough region, New Zealand from body-wave tomography: Implications for regional understanding of the 2016 Kaikoura Earthquake

**Ben Heath**

**Abstract**: Individual earthquake ruptures are usually assumed to occur on individual faults and are often associated with narrow regions (< 5 km) of altered physical properties, such as areas of increased fracturing and/or increased pore fluids. Recently, earthquakes such as the 2016 Kaikoura, New Zealand earthquake have ruptured multiple faults with different orientations over regions with widths spanning > 25 km. We test whether such regions hosting these earthquakes are associated with anomalous physical properties. We use seismic arrival-time tomography in the Kaikoura region to investigate lateral variations in V<sub>p</sub> and V<sub>p</sub>/V<sub>s</sub>, using these parameters to infer variation in crustal faulting/fracturing. By modeling the effect of fluid-filled fractures on lateral variations in V<sub>p</sub> and V<sub>p</sub>/V<sub>s</sub>, we are able to attribute the lateral variation in seismic velocities (over scales of > 50 km) to fault damage and pore fluid distribution. We find that the immature fault zones ruptured during the Kaikoura earthquake are on average characterized by decreased V<sub>p</sub> and elevated V<sub>p</sub>/V<sub>s</sub>, features that decay (over distances of 50 km) towards background levels with increased distance from Kaikoura earthquake faults (and increased proximity to more mature fault zones). Drops in V<sub>p</sub> in the Kaikoura  rupture region are found to linearly relate to increases in V<sub>p</sub>/V<sub>s</sub> at a rate that is consistent with elevated 0.01 aspect ratio fractures, with highest fracturing within 10 km of the ruptured faults. The broad regional fracture distribution is likely the result of distributed long-term deformation, with increased deformation in the Kaikoura  region. In contrast to more mature fault zones, which have localized strain accommodation and limited regional fracture distribution, immature fault zones are characterized by broadened, extensive fractures which contribute to complicated rupture dynamics.
