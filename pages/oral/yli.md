# New <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar and U-Pb age determination of magnetochron M0r from the Qingshan Group, Jiaolai Basin, eastern China

**Abstract**: Timing of the onset of magnetic polarity Chron M0r, and its duration, have long been disputed, reflecting both uncertain magnetostratigraphic correlations and a limited set of radioisotopic dates. We present a chronostratigraphic framework for a reversed polarity interval based on new paleomagnetic data, <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar sanidine dates (relative to 28.201 Ma Fish Canyon sanidine), and U-Pb zircon dates, recorded in the Qingshan Group in Jiaolai Basin, eastern China. From several tuffs, <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar dates from single sanidines and U-Pb chemical abrasion isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry (CA-ID-TIMS) dates from single zircons constrain the onset and termination of the reversed polarity interval. Whereas the U-Pb dates suggest a duration of 0.36 ± 0.12 Myr between 120.278 ± 0.047 and 119.916 ± 0.114 Ma, the <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar dates from the same tuffs span from 120.292 ± 0.081 to 119.723 ± 0.079 Ma and suggest a duration of 0.57 ± 0.11 Ma. Thus the two chronometers give indistinguishable results which both indicate that the short period of reversed polarity corresponds to magnetochron M0r rather than M-1r. Moreover, our findings are consistent with an astrochronologically constrained timescale for M-sequence seafloor magnetic anomalies that suggest a duration of M0r of 0.49 ± 0.11 Ma (Malinverno et al., 2012).
