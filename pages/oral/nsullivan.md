# Early Miocene cyclostratigraphy in the Southern Ocean: A window into the history of the Antarctic Ice Sheet

**Nicholas Sullivan**

**Abstract**: Benthic marine oxygen isotope (δ<sub>18</sub>O) records provide valuable insight into the history of the cryosphere from the perspective of a globally integrated signal that is generally far removed from the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS). These data have revealed the importance of astronomical forcing during the Miocene â€“ a time when atmospheric CO2 levels are estimated to range from 400 ppm to 600 ppm. This has motivated hypotheses of ice sheet history, astronomical forcing mechanisms, and ocean-cryosphere interactions. However, the distal benthic δ<sub>18</sub>O records are limited in their ability to evaluate regional processes that contribute to ice sheet variability. To better assess the cryosphere response, we investigate two ice-proximal marine records: ANDRILL 2A, adjacent to the West AIS, and ODP Site 1165, offshore from the East AIS.

A robust astronomical signal has been identified using TimeOpt across ~3 Ma of the Early Miocene. During warmer intervals (18 - 19 Ma), proximal environments adjacent to the West AIS are dominated by eccentricity and precession, consistent with the hypothesis that terrestrial ice sheets should responds to local insolation/atmospheric forcing. Records of a colder interval with an expanded ice sheet (17 - 18 Ma) are less complete. However, the obliquity sensitivity appears to be higher during these times, mirroring patterns observed in a δ<sub>18</sub>O megasplice, and consistent with the hypothesis that marine based ice sheets are impacted by obliquity-driven ocean dynamics. This behavior is observed at both ANDRILL 2A and ODP Site 1165, suggesting that the East AIS and portions of the West AIS have a similar response to astronomical forcing in the early Miocene. Ongoing work seeks to compile these sections into an integrated, regional depositional history. This may provide insight into the evolution of the AIS and Southern Ocean at a critical time of transition into the modern icehouse climate state.
