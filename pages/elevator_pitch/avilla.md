#  Testing assumptions on last interglacial seawater δ<sup>234</sup>U composition

**Alexandra Villa**

**Abstract**: The use of U-series dating of fossil corals has proved to be a crucial tool in creating Last Interglacial (LIG) chronologies of sea level change. These archives preserve the primary chemistry used to calculate a radiometric age, and track the position in sea level using their assumed paleodepth habitat. Using the U-series dating, we can achieve extremely accurate and precise measurements of age and elevation, under the assumption of presumed LIG δ<sup>234</sup>U value of seawater. This has been assumed to reflect modern day values of about 145‰, given the fact that U in the ocean is relatively constant. However, recent studies have suggested a 5-10 per mil δ<sup>234</sup>U change during the LGM, which challenges the assumption that LIG fossil corals reflect modern day values. This study seeks to determine possible values and changes in LIG δ<sup>234</sup>U values through a series of leaching experiments.
